This is my version of the code for a Hexmatrix triangluar LED clock; based on the designs and code from: https://www.instructables.com/RGB-HexMatrix-IOT-Clock/#

I added several enhancements and features, like adjustable automatic brightness adjustment based on sunrise and sunset.
You should be able to load this project straight into visual studio code with the platformIO extension and upload it to your clock.

This is my first time coding for arduino/esp32, so my C-code is not always as clean as I like it to be, use at your own risk!
